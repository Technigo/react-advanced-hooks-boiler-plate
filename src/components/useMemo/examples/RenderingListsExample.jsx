// EXPLANATION
// useState: Two state variables, comments and search, are defined using the useState hook to store the fetched comments and the search query, respectively.

// useEffect: The useEffect hook is utilized to fetch comments from an API when the component mounts. An asynchronous function getComments is defined and invoked within the useEffect to handle the API request. The empty dependency array [] ensures that this effect only runs once (on mount).

// useMemo: The useMemo hook is used to optimize the filtering of comments based on the search query. It returns a new array, searchedComments, containing comments that match the search query and only recomputes this array when the comments or search state changes (as specified in the dependency array [comments, search]).

// Rendering: The component renders a search input and a list of comments that match the search query. The searchedComments array, computed using useMemo, is mapped over to render each comment in a list item, ensuring that only relevant comments are rendered and unnecessary re-renders are minimized.
