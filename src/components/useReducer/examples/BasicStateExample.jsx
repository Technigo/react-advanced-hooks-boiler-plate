The counterReducer function helps decide what the new number (state) should be when a user clicks a button to increase or decrease it. The Counter component shows the current number and has two buttons. When you click a button, it tells the counterReducer function what to do (either add or subtract 1 from the number) by sending it a message, like 'INCREMENT'. The counterReducer function listens to this message and changes the number accordingly, which then updates on your screen.",
